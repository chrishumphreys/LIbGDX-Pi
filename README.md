Patches and compilation instructions to get LibGDX to use Lwjgl fullscreen on Raspberry Pi.

Also includes pre-built gdx-invaders game for Raspberry Pi.

See Instructions for build instructions.

See http://www.habitualcoder.com/?page_id=257 for blog post.


Note: If you simply want to use libgdx for your own game you do not need to compile it yourself - copy the pre-built gdx-invaders and add your own game jar!
